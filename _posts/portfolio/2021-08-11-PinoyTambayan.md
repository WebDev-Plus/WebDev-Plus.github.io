### Pinoy Tambayan Stor

PINOY TAMBAYAN, when translated, is equivalent to Filipino Hang-out place. It was set up in 2011 to provide the Filipino community of South Surrey/White Rock a store to buy Filipino/Asian foods and a money remittance service to the Philippines. Our goal is to give our clients the best shopping background as far as service when they miss and crave Filipino/Asian foods and provide them a remittance service with the best rate for their hard-earned money.
