<br/><br/>

- By 2022, cross-border purchasing is expected to account for 20% of all eCommerce sales.
- By 2024, global eCommerce revenues are estimated to total $6.4 trillion.
- Online buying is becoming more popular outside of national borders.
- In India, 14% of shoppers purchased things from the United States.

<br/><br/>
Convinced? Although expanding your eCommerce business globally is achievable, it does necessitate careful planning and execution. Follow along for advice on how to expand your online store worldwide.

## **International Expansion Requires a Combination of Marketing and Practicality**



Your mind may naturally jump to marketing when you hear the words "expanding your business." While you'd be correct in assuming that this post is about marketing, it's also about practicality, such as the speed of your website or international shipping. There are a few key elements to remember to help you get started:

<br/><br/>

### **Recognize Who Your Target Market Is**



Who you're trying to market to determines how you market. Even if you've determined that your target audience is "moms all over the world," you'll need to determine whether you need to alter your marketing strategy when virtually crossing international borders.

People from other countries are, well, distinctive! What makes people laugh in your home nation may upset people all around the world, so knowing who you're marketing to is critical.


You might use subtitles on videos or generate marketing content in multiple languages to overcome the language barrier. You may, for example, develop a website dedicated to a specific country you want to target. Because 72.4 percent of buyers claimed they would be more likely to buy a product with information in their own language, greeting customers in their native language is critical.

The first step, though, is to ensure that your clients can find your website in the first place, which means optimizing your new website for search engine optimization (SEO). Your website must be optimized for international search engines in order to rank worldwide.


You must translate 100 percent of your website to rank on international Search Engine Results Pages (SERP), which is the cornerstone to international eCommerce success. When a customer types a query into a search engine, the SERP is the list of results that appears. The following is a list of things to consider when translating your website:
<br/><br/>

- Subdomains or subcategories with language-specific subdomains or subcategories with unique URLs
- All written information on the website
- Information about metadata (example: meta descriptions)

<br/><br/>
You're on your way to expanding your eCommerce business overseas after you cater to your new market in their language and "style," as well as make sure they can easily find your website.

<br/><br/>

### **Make Sure Your Website Loads Fast and Works Well on Mobile Devices**


To rank on the [SERPs](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/serps), you need a fast website. Why? Because it is critical for a positive user experience, which is the search engines' top goal. Conversions and SEO rankings are both harmed by slow websites.

<br/><br/>

Here are some things you can do to improve website speed (and hence increase conversions and revenue):

<br/> 

- Take advantage of a content distribution network ([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network))
- Decompress files and optimize images
- Improve server response time
- Remove render-blocking Javascript
- Optimize your coding (Javascript, CSS, or HTML)
- Reduce the number of redirects
- Make use of browser caching

It's critical to guarantee that mobile customers have a positive experience on your website in addition to speeding it up. Mobile-friendly websites are not only preferred by Google, but they also enhance conversions.



Still have doubts about the importance of mobile website optimization? Let's take a look at the numbers for mobile eCommerce:

- A phone screen was used to open 68 percent of email campaigns.
- Mobile devices account for 56% of organic search engine visitors.

<br/><br/>
**Here's how to make your site mobile-friendly:**
<br/><br/>
- Make a search option available.
- Make sure that all photos and videos are mobile-friendly.
- Stay away from pop-ups.
- Improve menu navigation.
- Make sure all text on mobile devices is readable.
- Accept a wide range of payment options
<br/><br/>

### **Provide Worldwide Shipping That Is Quick (And Returns)**



Offer fast international shipping if you're selling physical products and want to expand your eCommerce store worldwide. International shipping is critical to a company's success on a worldwide scale. Consumers want (and expect) to receive their purchases in a timely way no matter where they are in the world. They don't want to wait weeks or months for something, nor do they want to pay a high delivery price. More information on international shipping can be found here.

It makes sensible to offer foreign payment methods when selling international delivery. Depending on the country, different payment options are preferred (and its culture).

Consider how your target market prefers to pay and provide them with those options. Consumers will find the checkout process easier if you provide more payment options (which will decrease cart abandonment rates).

Consider the following differences in payment preferences between Dutch and German consumers:


In the same way, foreign return options must be provided to customers. Consumers will be less likely to buy your products if you don't offer international returns. Returns serve as a safety net, ensuring that the customer receives what they expected or get their money back.



If you want to take your eCommerce business to the next level, you'll need to consider international delivery, payment options, and refunds.

<br/><br/>
## **Bottom line: Pay attention to your customers**



Your customers should always come first, whether we're talking about marketing or the practical side of expanding your eCommerce business worldwide. From the minute they click on your website to the moment they unbox your product, their purchasing experience with you should be smooth.

The key to expanding your eCommerce business overseas is to focus on your customers and their experience browsing your store, checking out, and receiving (and maybe returning) their purchases.


While ensuring your customers have a positive experience with your store all around the world isn't straightforward, it is surely achievable.
