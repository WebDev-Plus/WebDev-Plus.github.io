"<h3>1. Goal</h3>We design websites that produce results. To do so, our project manager will work
with you to identify strategies before we begin the project. We'll also figure out
who your target audience is so that we can build a template that fits them.",


"<h3>2. Design</h3>To ensure that we have the same idea, we'll give you an in-depth appropriate for
the analysis so that we can develop a design that reflects your objective. You will
receive a design concept for your website in 3-5 days.",


"<h3>3. Development</h3>When you're satisfied with the concept, our development team will bring it to life
and begin working on it. This will takes 3-4 weeks after your concept approval. It's
also the perfect time to give us your content at this time including content such as
information about your company, images, social profile, etc. ",


"<h3>4. Quality Assurance</h3>Your project will be handed over to our QA team after the initial development.
They will extensively analyze the design and production of your project before submitting it for your approval.",


"<h3>5. Client Review</h3>We'll give you a link to the test site after our QA team has reviewed your website
so you can see it on your screen. If you have changes before we start your project,
you will have several rounds of revisions during this process before we finish it.",

"<h3>6. Launching</h3>Your website will be hosted on our secure servers or on a web host of your choosing. You are free to launch your website right away if you are ready. If you want to set a launch date, we can help you with it.",



"<h3>7. Reviews</h3>We will assess the efficiency of your website after it has been launched to ensure
that your objectives have been met. We'll also make suggestions for improving
your website so that you can accomplish your objectives more effectively.",
